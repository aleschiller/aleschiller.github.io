    <p>Below are a few examples of the work I have done during my time at the University of Miami. The first two are posters that were created to advertise 'La Sportiva' hiking shoes, I chose two extreme travel locations to showcase the shoes. Both posters followed previous ad styles the company had done, using silhouettes of two men, one admiring Machu Picchu the other doing extreme mountain climbing with the Matterhorn in the background.</p>
    <p>The third image is a selfie I had that I turned into a Warhol inspired image.</p>
    <p>The fourth image is a branding project I did to create a logo for myself. The branding was created to show the designerâ€™s ability and personality, which was hopefully conveyed as fun and youthful. This project inspired creativity for the following work and really got the juices flowing.</p>
    <p> The fifth image was one I created just for my own amusement. It was a photo manipulation project is made up of six original images from pixabay. I used a variety of different tools to make it look like a Pineapple man was surfing, with the lasso tool, color overlay, several brushes, the blur tool and motion blur tool to create the effect of waves over the surfboard.</p>
    <p>Last, but not least was a Study Abroad poster for Barcelona, being that the program was a photography and storytelling workshop, a photograph that was visually striking and interesting was essential, something that would be taken by a photography student. The photograph was of a church stain glass beautifully captured. The photo was going to be difficult to lay text over.</p>
