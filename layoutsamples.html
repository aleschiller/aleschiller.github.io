          <p>This was my first attempt at designing a magzine and this was before I was taught about grids. The magazine was inspired by surf culture and was created for surfer girls with several articles about style, food and exercise. The layout online extends 16 pages and this layout in particular was created to be interactive, if you <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/fd939719-8e6f-4dcd-ab88-397d6dfbd391"><u>click here</u></a> you will be taken to the adobe site where you will be able to navigate through the pages.</p>

        <div align="center"><a href="Magazine.pdf"> <img src="serendipity.png" alt="Food Magazine Spread" height="528" width="809"class="center-image"></a><p>[PDF 1.9MB]</p>
        </div>
          <p>The magazine was created to target the “Foodies” of Miami, the people who love to indulge in tasty treats. The three main focuses through the spread were food trucks,happening Sunday brunches and a local ice cream parlor in Wynwood, Serendipity. Becuase Miami is such a vibrant city the images and color palette reflected that, with bright magenta’s and pinks with blues. For the main article on Serendipity the layout centered around the image of the ice cream against the pink flamingo backdrop and similar pinks were and white’s were used to accentuate the photo. For the food truck image, because it was such a bright, loud image, the type was dragged across both pages of the spread, and the “Best Food Trucks” stamp was created in photoshop with a white circle backdrop added after. The final spread was of the best party brunches across Miami to keep the magazine feeling young and fun as it is appealing to a younger, trendy demographic.</p>

            <p>This newsletter was made for the University of Miami School of Communication for incoming, current or perspective students. The cover was created first with the image of the School of Communication building with the Communique title added. The information was about the school itself, the internship programs and student organizations. The newsletter was meant to entice potential students to become part of the School of Communication and also educate current students about available resources, programs and facilities. The spreads were all laid out simply with the orange and green school colors throughout and with only three typefaces for consistency throughout.</p>
